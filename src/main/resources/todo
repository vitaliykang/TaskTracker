- Need to create 'completed_tasks' table in the database, that will store all the tasks that were marked as completed.
    * 'tasks' table will store only current tasks to reduce load on the mainframe;
    * when the task is marked as finished, its copy is created in the 'completed_tasks' table, and the entry is deleted
        from the 'tasks' table.

- Need to add 'Status' type String field to Task and CompletedTask
